\section{Given Requirements for document}
Each team is required to provide a Requirements Analysis Report. This will document your teams understanding of the specification. As well as addressing the specification itself, the report should also document any decisions that have been made in terms of group management (i.e. how you have organized yourselves to meet the goals of this project, how often you will meet, how you will address decision making etc.) and provide a list of requirements that your team have decided will meet the customer's needs.
A requirements analysis report should provide an outline of the features that the final solution will provide. Remember that requirements need to be detailed, justified and verifiable. Consider your validation process carefully, along with why you've chosen to include certain features.
This part of your first deliverable must not exceed four sides of A4. Any appendices or other attachments will be removed.

\section{Introduction}
% Justifies the need for the system and outlines what it will do.

\section{User Requirements Design}
% Describes the services provided for the users. Written in natural language with diagrams.
Requirement 1.C: the user must be able to input the rate of traffic flow from each direction to each other direction via text fields (one per traffic flow) in the User Interface (UI).
Requirement 2.C: the user must be able to adjust the following settings for each road entering the junction, affecting the results of the simulation: how many lanes there are (1 to 5), whether there is a left-turn lane, bus lane, cycle lane (all mutually exclusive, the latter two requiring separate traffic flow rates) or none of those three, whether there is a pedestrian crossing (requires the duration of time the crossing is active and the number of crossing requests per hour), and the traffic light sequencing priority (0 to 4, 0 meaning no priority, 4 meaning highest priority).
Requirement 3.C: after running the simulation, for each junction configuration, the user must be provided with the following three junction efficiency metrics per road entering the junction, as well as an overall score generated from the three metrics for the whole configuration: average wait time, maximum wait time, and maximum queue length.

\section{System Architecture}
% Presents a high-level overview of the system, showing distribution of functions across system modules.

\section{System Requirements Specification}
% Describes functional and non-functional requirements.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
R.1D
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system must accept input from the text fields, parse the input to determine if each traffic flow is a valid number, and, if all traffic flows are valid, allow the simulation to be ran.
  \item Priority: must
  \item Verification: running the simulation with one set of valid traffic flow rates in the text fields, running it again with a different set in the same fields and verifying the junction efficiency metrics have changed, and then trying to run the simulation with an invalid value in at least one text field (e.g. “TEST” for Eastbound Traffic Flow Exiting West)
  \item Traceability: Input Parameters section in the specification
\end{itemize}

R.2D
\begin{itemize}
  \item For each junction configuration, the system must take into account its specific settings, adjusting the calculations performed by the simulation for that specific configuration
  \item Priority: must
  \item Verification: run a simulation with default parameters (2 lanes per road entering the junction, equal priority on all lights, and all other settings set to off/No) as a reference, and then run a simulation per setting with that setting adjusted, showing the results of each simulation is different from the reference.
  \item Traceability: Configurable Parameters section in the specification
\end{itemize}

R.3D
\begin{itemize}
  \item When the simulation is ran, for each junction configuration, the system must take the configuration and the input traffic flow rates (shared across all configurations) and calculate the average wait time, maximum wait time and maximum queue length per direction entering the junction, as well as combine these metrics to calculate an overall score for the whole configuration
  \item Priority: must
  \item Verification: run the simulation once with two different configurations or twice with a single configuration and different traffic flows, and verify that there is a difference between the metrics and overall score of the configurations/simulation runs
  \item Traceability: Output section in the specification
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

\section{System Evolution}
% Describes assumptions on which the system is based and anticipated changes due to changing user needs, and hardware evolution.
