\section{Given Requirements for document}
Each team is required to provide a Requirements Analysis Report. This will document your teams understanding of the specification. As well as addressing the specification itself, the report should also document any decisions that have been made in terms of group management (i.e. how you have organized yourselves to meet the goals of this project, how often you will meet, how you will address decision making etc.) and provide a list of requirements that your team have decided will meet the customer's needs.
A requirements analysis report should provide an outline of the features that the final solution will provide. Remember that requirements need to be detailed, justified and verifiable. Consider your validation process carefully, along with why you've chosen to include certain features.
This part of your first deliverable must not exceed four sides of A4. Any appendices or other attachments will be removed.
